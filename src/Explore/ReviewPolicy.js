      <h5>
        We are committed to prompt evaluation and publication of fully accepted
        papers in all International Journal of Computer and Electronics
        Engineering (IJCEE) To maintain a high-quality publication, all
        submissions undergo a rigorous process. Characteristics of the peer
        review process are as follows:
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Simultaneous submissions of the same manuscript to different
            journals will not be tolerated.
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>
            {" "}
            Manuscripts with contents outside the scope will not be considered
            for review.{" "}
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>
            Depending on individual journal policy, submissions usually will be
            refereed by 2 experts as suggested by the editorial board
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>
            {" "}
            In addition, Editors will have the option of seeking additional
            reviews when needed.     Authors will be informed when Editors decide further review is required.
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>       All publication decisions are made by the journal's Editors-in-Chief on
        the basis of the referees' reports. Authors of papers that are not
        accepted are notified promptly. </li>
        <p></p>

        <li> All submitted manuscripts are treated as
        confidential documents. We expect our Board of Reviewing Editors and
        reviewers to treat manuscripts as confidential material as well. Editors
        and reviewers involved in the review process should disclose conflicts
        of interest resulting from direct competitive, collaborative, or other
        relationships with any of the authors, and remove oneself from cases in
        which such conflicts preclude an objective evaluation. Privileged
        information or ideas that are obtained through peer review must not be
        used for competitive gain.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li> Our peer review process is confidential and
        identities of reviewers cannot be revealed.</li>
