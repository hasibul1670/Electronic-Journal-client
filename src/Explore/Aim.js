        The International Journal of Computer and Electronics Engineering
        (IJCEE) is a peer-reviewed journal that covers a wide range of topics
        related to computer and electronics engineering. The journal aims to
        publish original research articles, review articles, and technical notes
        that provide novel insights and solutions to problems in these fields.

        The journal welcomes submissions from researchers, academicians, and
        practitioners from around the world. The manuscripts submitted to IJCEE
        should present original and significant contributions to the field of
        computer and electronics engineering, and they should not have been
        published or submitted elsewhere. The papers are evaluated through a
        rigorous peer-review process, and the accepted manuscripts are published
        online and in print.
